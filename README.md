# Overdue

**Never forget the tasks that slip your mind.**

Overdue reminds you how long itâ€™s been since you last completed a task and alerts you when itâ€™s time to do it again.

Perfect for infrequent chores, personal goals, or anything that isnâ€™t daily.  
Set tasks, mark them done, and get custom notificationsâ€”stay consistent without the stress.
